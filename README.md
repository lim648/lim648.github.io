# Tutorial: Implementing TSMA for Unbalanced Data in R
This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the Two-Stage Model Aggregation (TSMA) approach, designed to enhance the performance of predictive models on unbalanced datasets. The TSMA framework integrates bagging concepts, resampling techniques, and advanced machine-learning strategies to improve model accuracy significantly.

## R Code
The R code used in this tutorial can be found in the **R Code** folder.

## Example Data
The example data utilized for the tutorial is located in the **Data** folder.
