# Tutorial: Implementing TSMA for Unbalanced Data in R
This tutorial guides you through implementing the two-stage sampling aggregation ($\mbox{TSMA}$), 
designed to handle unbalanced datasets. The $\mbox{TSMA}$ framework 
incorporates bagging concepts, resampling techniques, and machine-learning techniques 
aimed at significantly improving the accuracy of predictive models.

## Data Preparation
### Loading Data
### Data Splitting

## Model Training
### Elastic Net with Under resampling techniques

### $\mbox{TSMA}_{\text{EN}}$
